This project aims to address the *new high-priority feature* requested by the Business Operations (BizOps) team for our loan qualifier software. In particular, the project provides a step-by step procedure through which BizOps can see how the software can prompt the users to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

The program not only provides a repeatable user friendly application that determines client eligibility for loans using financial data including *credit score*, *monthly debt*, *monthly income*, and *borrower home value*, but also allows clients save their data in an easy-to-read spread sheet format.
